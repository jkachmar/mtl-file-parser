# Simple Haskell File Parser

This is a simple CLI tool, written in Haskell, that I used to help familiarize
myself with the [`optparse-applicative`] and [`mtl`] packages.

All code in this repository has been adapted from [Josh Clayton's] wonderful
[file-fun] example, and the incredibly informative accompanying [blog post].
